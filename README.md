# About

This module manages the [Bacula](http://bacula.org) backup solution.  Through
declaration of the `bacula` class, you can configure Directors, Storage Daemons,
Clients, and consoles.

This module is a fork of the [Puppet Labs](http://puppetlabs.com/)
[Bacula](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/bacula) module.

# Configuration

There is one class (`bacula`) that needs to be declared on all nodes managing
any component of Bacula. These nodes are configured using the parameters of
this class.

## Using Parameterized Classes

[Using Parameterized Classes](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/parameterized_classes.html)

Declaration example:

```puppet
  class { 'bacula':
    console_password  => 'consolepassword',
    director_password => 'directorpassword',
    director_server   => 'bacula.example.com',
    is_client         => true,
    is_director       => true,
    is_storage        => true,
    mail_to           => 'bacula-admin@example.com',
    manage_console    => true,
    storage_server    => 'bacula.example.com',
  }
```

## Parameters

The following lists all the class parameters the `bacula` class accepts.

### clients

For directors, `clients` is a hash of clients.  The keys are the clients while
the values are a hash of parameters. The parameters accepted are the same as
the `bacula::client::config` define.

### console_password

The password to use for the console resource on the director

### console_template

The ERB template to use for configuring the `bconsole` instead of the one
included with the module

included with the module

### is_client

Whether the node should be a client

### is_director

Whether the node should be a director

### is_storage

### logwatch_enabled

If `manage_logwatch` is `true` should the Bacula logwatch configuration be
enabled or disabled

### mail_command

The [command](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Messages_Resource.html#12970)
bacula will use to send mail.

Defaults to `"/usr/sbin/bsmtp -h localhost -f bacula@${::fqdn} -s \"Bacula %t %e (for %c)\" %r"`.

### mail_to

Send the message to this email address for all jobs. Will default to
`root@${::fqdn}` if it and `mail_to_on_error` are left undefined.

### mail_to_daemon

Send daemon messages to this email address. Will default to either `$mail_to`
or `$mail_to_on_error` in that order if left undefined.

### mail_to_on_error

Send the message to this email address if the Job terminates with an error
condition.

### mail_to_operator

Send the message to this email addresse for mount messages. Will default to
either `$mail_to` or `$mail_to_on_error` in that order if left undefined.

### manage_bat

Whether the bat should be managed on the node

### manage_config_dir

Whether to purge all non-managed files from the bacula config directory

### manage_console

Whether the `bconsole` should be managed on the node

### manage_db

Whether to manage creation of the database specified by `db_database`. Defaults
to false. In order for this to work, you must declare the `mysql::server` class

### manage_db_tables

Whether to manage the SQL tables in the database specified by `db_backend`.
Defaults to `true`.

### manage_logwatch

Whether to configure [logwatch](http://www.logwatch.org/) on the director

### operator_command

The [command](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Messages_Resource.html#12997)
bacula will use to send mail for Operator messages.

Defaults to `"/usr/sbin/bsmtp -h localhost -f bacula@${::fqdn} -s \"Bacula Intervention Required (for %c)\" %r"`.

### plugin_dir

The directory Bacula plugins are stored in. Use this parameter if you are
providing Bacula plugins for use. Only use if the package in the distro
repositories supports plugins or you have included a respository with a newer
Bacula packaged for your distro. If this is anything other than `undef` and you
are not providing any plugins in this directory Bacula will throw an error
every time it starts even if the package supports plugins.

### storage_default_mount

Directory where the default disk for file backups is mounted. A subdirectory
named `default` will be created allowing you to define additional devices in
Bacula which use the same disk. Defaults to `'/mnt/bacula'`.

### storage_server

The FQDN of the storage server

### storage_template

The ERB template to use for configuring the storage daemon instead of the one
included with the module

### tls_allowed_cn
Array of common name attribute of allowed peer certificates. If this directive
is specified, all server certificates will be verified against this list. This
can be used to ensure that only the CA-approved Director may connect.

### tls_ca_cert

The full path and filename specifying a PEM encoded TLS CA certificate(s).
Multiple certificates are permitted in the file. One of
`TLS CA Certificate File` or `TLS CA Certificate Dir` are required in a server
context if `TLS Verify Peer` is also specified, and are always required in a
client context.

### tls_ca_cert_dir

Full path to TLS CA certificate directory. In the current implementation,
certificates must be stored PEM encoded with OpenSSL-compatible hashes, which
is the subject name's hash and an extension of .0. One of
`TLS CA Certificate File` or `TLS CA Certificate Dir` are required in a server
context if `TLS Verify Peer` is also specified, and are always required in a
client context.

### tls_cert

The full path and filename of a PEM encoded TLS certificate. It can be used as
either a client or server certificate. PEM stands for Privacy Enhanced Mail,
but in this context refers to how the certificates are encoded. It is used
because PEM files are base64 encoded and hence ASCII text based rather than
binary. They may also contain encrypted information.

### tls_key

The full path and filename of a PEM encoded TLS private key. It must correspond
to the TLS certificate.

### tls_require

Require TLS connections. This directive is ignored unless `TLS Enable` is set
to `yes`. If TLS is not required, and TLS is enabled, then Bacula will connect
with other daemons either with or without TLS depending on what the other
daemon requests. If TLS is enabled and TLS is required, then Bacula will refuse
any connection that does not use TLS. Valid values are `'yes'` or `'no'`.

### tls_verify_peer

Verify peer certificate. Instructs server to request and verify the client's
x509 certificate. Any client certificate signed by a known-CA will be accepted
unless the `TLS Allowed CN` configuration directive is used, in which case the
client certificate must correspond to the Allowed Common Name specified.
Valid values are `'yes'` or `'no'`.

### use_console

Whether to configure a console resource on the director

### use_tls

Whether to use [Bacula TLS - Communications Encryption](http://www.bacula.org/en/dev-manual/main/main/Bacula_TLS_Communications.html).

### use_vol_purge_script

Run a script to automatically clean up old volumes from the default file pool
after the BackupCatalog job is run each day. It is only valid if the Director
and the Storage daemon are running on the same host. `true` or `false` (default).

### use_vol_purge_mvdir

The volume purge script can move volume files to a side directory for further
inspection instead of removing the volume files. Bacula has a tendency (at
least as of version 5.0.x) to occasionally label volume files incorrectly or
store jobs in a volume labeled differently than the job name. Takes an absolute
file file path to a directory or `undef` the default.

### volume_autoprune

[Auto prune volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#AutoPrune) in the default pool.

### volume_autoprune_diff

[Auto prune volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#AutoPrune) in the default differential pool.

### volume_autoprune_full

[Auto prune volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#AutoPrune) in the default full pool.

### volume_autoprune_incr

[Auto prune volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#AutoPrune) in the default incremental pool.

### volume_retention

Length of time to [retain volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#VolRetention) in the default pool.

### volume_retention_diff

Length of time to [retain volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#VolRetention) in the default differential pool.

### volume_retention_full

Length of time to [retain volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#VolRetention) in the default full pool.

### volume_retention_incr

Length of time to [retain volumes](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#VolRetention) in the default incremental pool.

# Custom FileSets

## `bacula::director::fileset` Parameters

### ensure

Ensure the file is present or absent.  The only valid values are `file` or
`absent`. Defaults to `file`.

### exclude_files

An array of strings consisting of one file or directory name per
entry. Directory names should be specified without a trailing slash with Unix
path notation.

### include_files

**Required**: An array of strings consisting of one file or directory name per
entry. Directory names should be specified without a trailing slash with Unix
path notation.

# Custom Director configuration

For the highly likely case (given Bacula's complexity) where more complex
configuration is needed you can include a file of additional configurations
from your own modules.

## `bacula::director::custom_config` Parameters

### ensure

Ensure the file is present or absent.  The only valid values are `file` or
`absent`. Defaults to `file`.

### content

String containing the content for the configuration file.  Usually supplied
with a template.

### source

The source location of the configuration file to deploy in `bacula-dir.d`.

# Clients

To back up clients on your network, you need to tell the director about them.
The director is whichever node you included the `bacula` class and you specified
the parameter `is_director` to `true`.  The way to add clients is different
depending on if you're using
[exported resources](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/exported_resources.html),
or a hash of client information provided to the `bacula` class's `clients`
parameter on the director node. Each will need to know the parameters of the
`bacula::client::config` defined resource.

## `bacula::client::config` Parameters

### ensure

If the configuration should be deployed to the director. `file` (default),
`present`, or `absent`.

### backup_enable

If the backup job for the client should be enabled `'yes'` (default)
or `'no'`.

### client_schedule

The schedule for backups to be performed.

### db_backend

The database back end of the catalog storing information about the backup

### director_password

The director's password the client is connecting to.

### director_server

The FQDN of the director server the client will connect to.

### fileset

The file set used by the client for backups

### pool

The pool used by the client for backups

### pool_diff

The pool to use for differential backups. Setting this to `false` will prevent
configuring a specific pool for differential backups. Defaults to
`"${pool}.differential"`.

### pool_full
The pool to use for full backups. Setting this to `false` will prevent
configuring a specific pool for full backups. Defaults to `"${pool}.full"`.

### pool_incr

The pool to use for incremental backups. Setting this to `false` will prevent
configuring a specific pool for incremental backups. Defaults to
`"${pool}.incremental"`.

### priority

This directive permits you to control the order in which your jobs will be run
by specifying a positive non-zero number. The higher the number, the lower the
job priority. Assuming you are not running concurrent jobs, all queued jobs of
priority `1` will run before queued jobs of priority `2` and so on, regardless
of the original scheduling order.  The priority only affects waiting jobs that
are queued to run, not jobs that are already running. If one or more jobs of
priority `2` are already running, and a new job is scheduled with priority `1`,
the currently running priority `2` jobs must complete before the priority 1 job
is run, unless `Allow Mixed Priority` is set. The default priority is `10`.

### rerun_failed_levels

If this directive is set to `'yes'` (default `'no'`), and Bacula detects that a
previous job at a higher level (i.e. Full or Differential) has failed, the
current job level will be upgraded to the higher level. This is particularly
useful for Laptops where they may often be unreachable, and if a prior Full
save has failed, you wish the very next backup to be a Full save rather than
whatever level it is started as.

There are several points that must be taken into account when using this
directive: first, a failed job is defined as one that has not terminated
normally, which includes any running job of the same name (you need to ensure
that two jobs of the same name do not run simultaneously); secondly, the
`Ignore FileSet Changes` directive is not considered when checking for failed
levels, which means that any FileSet change will trigger a rerun.

### restore_enable

If the restore job for the client should be enabled `'yes'` (default)
or `'no'`.

### restore_where

The default path to restore files to defined in the restore job for this client.

### run_scripts

An array of hashes containing the parameters for any [RunScripts](http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/Configuring_Director.html#6971)
to include in the backup job definition. For each hash in the array a
`RunScript` directive block will be inserted with the `key = value` settings
from the hash.  Note: The `RunsWhen` key is required.

### storage_server

The storage server hosting the pool this client will backup to

### tls_ca_cert

The full path and filename specifying a PEM encoded TLS CA certificate(s).
Multiple certificates are permitted in the file. One of
`TLS CA Certificate File` or `TLS CA Certificate Dir` are required in a server
context if `TLS Verify Peer` is also specified, and are always required in a
client context.

### tls_ca_cert_dir

Full path to TLS CA certificate directory. In the current implementation,
certificates must be stored PEM encoded with OpenSSL-compatible hashes, which
is the subject name's hash and an extension of .0. One of
`TLS CA Certificate File` or `TLS CA Certificate Dir` are required in a server
context if `TLS Verify Peer` is also specified, and are always required in a
client context.

### tls_require

Require TLS connections. This directive is ignored unless `TLS Enable` is set
to `yes`. If TLS is not required, and TLS is enabled, then Bacula will connect
with other daemons either with or without TLS depending on what the other
daemon requests. If TLS is enabled and TLS is required, then Bacula will refuse
any connection that does not use TLS. Valid values are `'yes'` or `'no'`.

### use_tls

Whether to use [Bacula TLS - Communications Encryption](http://www.bacula.org/en/dev-manual/main/main/Bacula_TLS_Communications.html).

## Using Exported Resources

Exported resources are probably the most flexible way of deploying this module
involving the least amount of admin interaction to be successful.  The drawback
is the intense overhead of
[stored configurations](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Using_Stored_Configuration)
on your Puppet master.

### Example

```puppet
node /web-server\d+/ {
  $director_password = 'directorpassword'
  $director_server   = "bacula-dir1.${::domain}"

  # First install and configure bacula-fd pointing to the director.
  class { 'bacula':
    director_password => $director_password,
    director_server   => $director_server,
    is_client         => true,
    storage_server    => $director_server,
  }

  # Now we declare the exported resource so that it will be available to
  # install the needed configuration on the director server
  @@bacula::client::config { $::fqdn:
    client_schedule   => 'WeeklyCycle',
    director_password => $director_password,
    director_server   => $director_server,
    fileset           => 'Basic:noHome',
    storage_server    => $director_server,
  }
}

node /bacula-dir\d+/ {
  $director_password = 'directorpassword'
  $director_server   = $::fqdn

  # Lets set up the director server.
  class { '::bacula':
    console_password  => 'consolepassword',
    director_password => $director_password,
    director_server   => $director_server,
    is_client         => false,
    is_director       => true,
    is_storage        => true,
    mail_to           => "admin@${::domain}",
    storage_server    => $director_server,
  }

  # Now lets realize all of the exported client config resources configured to
  # backup to this director server.
  Bacula::Client::Config <<| director_server == $::fqdn |>>
}
```

## Using `clients` Parameter Hash

The `bacula` class takes a `clients` parameter.  The value for `clients` must
be a hash with the keys of the hash being the FQDN of the client.  The value of
the client needs to be a hash containing the parameters for each client.

The advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented without stored
configurations which will allow for scaling your Puppet masters much further.
The disadvantage is that the `clients` hash must be maintained by hand or by
an external provider such as an ENC, heira, or some other means which
introduces maintanance overhead and / or complexity in your environment.

### Example

```puppet
node /web-server\d+/ {
  $director_password = 'directorpassword'
  $director_server   = "bacula-dir1.${::domain}"

  # First install and configure bacula-fd pointing to the director.
  class { 'bacula':
    director_password => $director_password,
    director_server   => $director_server,
    is_client         => true,
    storage_server    => $director_server,
  }

}

node /bacula-dir\d+/ {
  $director_password = 'directorpassword'
  $director_server   = $::fqdn

  # Now we setup the clients hash so the configuration files can be created
  # for the director config.
  # Note the values for the director and storage parameters will be derived
  # from the values passed to the `bacula::director` class so they only have to
  # be provided if they are different.
  $bacula_clients = {
    "web-server1.${::domain}" => {
      client_schedule => 'WeeklyCycle',
      fileset         => 'Basic:noHome',
    },
    "web-server2.${::domain}" => {
      client_schedule => 'WeeklyCycle',
      fileset         => 'Basic:noHome',
    },
  }

  # Lets set up the director server.
  class { '::bacula':
    clients           => $bacula_clients,
    console_password  => 'consolepassword',
    director_password => $director_password,
    director_server   => $director_server,
    is_client         => false,
    is_director       => true,
    is_storage        => true,
    mail_to           => "admin@${::domain}",
    storage_server    => $director_server,
  }

  # Now lets realize all of the exported client config resources configured to
  # backup to this director server.
  Bacula::Client::Config <<| director_server == $::fqdn |>>
}
```

# Templates

The Bacula module comes with templates that set default Fileset resources.  To
configure different Filesets, copy the `bacula-dir.conf.erb` file out of the
`bacula/templates` directory to another location in your manifests (can be
another module).  Make the modifications you want and set the
`director_template` parameter (listed above) to point to the path where you have
stored the custom template.

[Using Puppet Templates](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/templating.html)

# TODO

* Add ability to create custom Filesets.
* Add ability to create custom schedules.
* Add ability to configure storage servers external to the director.
* Add ability to configure multiple pools on a storage server
* [rspec-puppet](http://rspec-puppet.com/) unit tests.
